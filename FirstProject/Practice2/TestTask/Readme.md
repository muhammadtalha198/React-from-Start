/*

  You're working on the UI prototype for an online shop and your task is to output two TestComponent items (via the <TestComponent /> 
  component you find in the TestComponent.js file) below the main page title ("My Demo Shop") in the App component.


*/

The two TestComponent items should use the same component (<TestComponent />) but output different data (title, price & description). Data should be passed to the components (and output there) via props.

The first TestComponent item is expected to display the following information:

Title: TestComponent 1

Price: 10

Description: First TestComponent

The second TestComponent item is expected to display the following information:

Title: TestComponent 2

Price: 20

Description: Second TestComponent
